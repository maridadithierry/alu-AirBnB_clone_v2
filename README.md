This repository showcases the first phase of a student project aimed at creating a replica of the AirBnB website. In this phase, a backend interface or console is developed to handle program data. The console's commands enable users to create, update, and delete objects, along with managing file storage. By employing JSON serialization and deserialization, data storage is maintained across sessions.
